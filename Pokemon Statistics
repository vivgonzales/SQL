Database courtsey of Pamela Fox https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/26b9357c6120d3d0d27c2b90c950e8c6

This database contains Pokemon statistics providing their name, type, total, HP, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, 
speed, generation and if they are a legendary pokemon or not.

With this data, I want to answer a few of the following questions:

-- Who are the top 3 fastest grass pokemon?
SELECT name FROM pokemon 
WHERE Type_1 = "Grass"
ORDER BY speed desc
LIMIT 3;

-- What is the average HP of all pokemon based on generation?
SELECT generation, AVG(HP) AS Total_HP 
FROM pokemon
GROUP BY generation;

-- What pokemon are legendary?
SELECT name FROM pokemon 
WHERE legendary = "True";

-- What is the average attack level of dragon types?
SELECT Type_1, AVG(attack) AS Average_attack 
FROM pokemon
WHERE Type_1 = "Dragon";

-- What dark pokemon do you want to capture based on their special attack skills?
SELECT name, sp_atk, type_1
FROM pokemon
WHERE sp_atk > 100 AND type_1 = "Dark"
ORDER BY sp_atk;

-- What pokemon are considered fast or slow based on their speed status?
SELECT name, speed,
CASE
WHEN speed > 80 THEN "fast"
ELSE "slow"
END AS fast_slow
FROM pokemon
ORDER BY speed;

-- What is the sum total of pokemon based on generation?
SELECT generation, SUM(total) AS total_total
FROM pokemon
GROUP BY generation;
